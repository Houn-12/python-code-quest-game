# Variables and Data Types
      
In Python, variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout your program.
Unlike some other programming languages, you don't need to declare a variable's type before using it.

## Common Data Types

1. **Integers** - Whole numbers like 3, 100, or -5
2. **Floats** - Decimal numbers like 3.14 or -0.001
3. **Strings** - Text enclosed in quotes like "hello" or 'Python'
4. **Booleans** - True or False values

## Creating Variables

In Python, you create a variable by assigning a value to it using the equals sign (=):

# Conditional Statements
      
Conditional statements let your program make decisions based on certain conditions.
They allow different code to execute depending on whether a condition is True or False.

## Types of Conditional Statements

1. **if statement** - Executes a block of code if a condition is True
2. **elif statement** - Checks another condition if the previous conditions were False
3. **else statement** - Executes when all previous conditions are False

## Comparison Operators

- **==** Equal to
- **!=** Not equal to
- **>** Greater than
- **<** Less than
- **>=** Greater than or equal to
- **<=** Less than or equal to

# Loops in Python
      
Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. They're essential for automating repetitive tasks.

## Types of Loops

1. **For Loops** - Execute a block of code for each item in a sequence
2. **While Loops** - Execute a block of code as long as a condition is True

## Loop Control Statements

- **break** - Exits the loop completely
- **continue** - Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one
- **else** - Executes after the loop completes normally (not when broken by a break statement)
